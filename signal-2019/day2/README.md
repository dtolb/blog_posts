![trusted](pics/keynote-trusted.jpg)

#### Overview

* Generally speaking, most people don't answer calls
* 75% of calls are unanswered when caller is unknown
* 48 billion robo-calls ðŸ¤– in the USA
* $5 Average cost of outbound call from call-center
* Carriers working on protocols to verify calls

#### How it works

* displays message and logo
* Create business profile = vetted and profiled by twilio
* Verifies phone number is owned by company, that there is an API call driving it, and company is verified in order to display the logo.
* Give reason for placing call
* When call rings the reasoning and logo and etc... are displayed on device
* Parter with YouMail, hiya
* Works through an app
* Best guess:  it works via an installed app like robo killer or something elseâ€¦ where you have your native mobile number set to forward to a proxy number that then looks up who is calling. Then forwards the call back to your cell device.
  * Needs 'diversion' information from the network to successfully operate
  * Also forwards **all** incoming calls through a 3rd party


### IoT

* Rently getting a shoutout

## Presidio

![who they are](pics/Presidio.jpg)

* Why Cloud?
  * They want to put out new features
  * Competing with larger digital companies
* Why Flex?
  * Highest level of programmability and customization in the industry
  * Talk to their customers about twilio flex
  * $5.7B USD spent on on-prem PBX
* Migration Challenges
  * Don't want contact center isolated
  * Still need e911
  * Agent retraining cost
* Fix
  * Used a phased migration
  * CC Isolation (use programmable SIP)
    * Probably can combine network bridge (BYOC) with Flex
* Can you integrate flex into a PBX
  * Flex has their API
  * On-prem PBX has JTAPI & TAPI SDK
  * Teams & Skype has elementary SDK
* Leveraging task router
* Overall impressive integration with everything. But can imagine it's a bit fragile.

## Texting First

![txt first](pics/txtfirst.jpg)

* Phone, email, chat all have issues
  * Phone is time consuming and people don't answer calls
  * Email is relatively slow and SPAM issues
  * Chat is great for one-and-done but not continuous support
* [Precision Services](https://www.precisiontv.com) manages their support queue via Twilio
  * Ran into labor cost issues
  * Discovered that texting the clients got better response than outbound call scheduling
  * Use the Twilio TN lookup API
* Respond to all MMS and other means of communications
* Offer SMS routes to customers in a Queue for over 1 minute
