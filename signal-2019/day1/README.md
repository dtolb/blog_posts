## answering machine detection

![answer](pics/answer.jpg)

* Automated calling problem
  * Only 24% of un-id'd calls are answers
* Customers are not answering calls, even if they have value
* When calls are answered, how do you make that XP better?
* AMD will will inform your application whether a human, machine, or fax answered the call.
* Three primary segments
  1. Alerts and notifications
  2. Outbound IVR (product survey)
  3. Outbound sales (insurance)
* Twilio AMD is now in v3
* Learned that AMD is a critical tool for many calling use-cases
* First gen didn't meet the bar. Unreliable & few controls
* Wasn't really understood when it was black boxed... customers wanted to learn how it works and what works.
* Previously not a good way to view AMD performance
* AMD now has a few new parameters:
  * Threshold
  * Speech end threshold
* AMD today is that no action can be done during detection
* "Background" AMD... outbound call put into conference, while AMD agent is processing, the other participant that's in the conference is playing twiml.
  * If human, conference an agent in, they can hear the twiml and can seemlessly pickup
  * If machine, interrupt the audio and play from there.
* Moving forward
  * Roadmap driven by customer feedback
  * Mediastreams beta is similar in vain to AMD

## Stripe and Twilio

* `<Pay>` allows PCI compliant transactions
* [inboxhealth](https://inboxhealth.com) uses these together to assist with healthcare payments
* Nothing too new from last year in the demo except GA
* For those wanting to collect payments over the phone, relatively straight forward implementation

## BYOC

![BYOC](pics/BYOC.jpg)

  * Not always ready to change PSTN provider
  * Wanted twilio API and their super network
* Why Not switch?

  * Longstanding relationships with Tier-1 Carriers
  * Infrastructure investments
  * Different carriers throughout the world
  * not ready for the cloud
