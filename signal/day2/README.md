## Solving Sudoku in Swift
### [Soroush Khanlou](https://twitter.com/@khanlou)

![Soroush Khanlou](pics/soroushKhanlou.png)

* `let ` is immutable
* `var` is mutable
* Check out his [github](https://github.com/khanlou)
* How to solve any [sudoku](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html)
* Swift has two patterns for data
    * Class
    * Struct -> if you have a reference to a struct, it's yours. So if you mutate it doesn't affect anyone else;
* Sequence and collection handling is well done in swift
* Swift's error handling system is very explicit because of the Type System

## Build and Scale Real-Time Video with Programmable Video
### Rob Brazier & Luis Lopez

![Rob and Luis](pics/robAndLuis.png)

* Voice and messaging is great, but doesn't work for everything
    * Doctors
    * Developer hiring - hackerrannk
    * Online Bank - Monese

> Video calling is the fastest growing activity millennials do on their phones.

* 87% of millennials managers perfer video calling for collaboration
* By 2018 more than 6.2 **BILLION** people will be using a webRTC capable device

> Humans process data at a _much_ higher rate than other senses

![Why video](pics/whyVideoBandwidth.png)

* Twilio Rooms (group rooms) - 50 max connections and recordable via Twilio.

![SFU vs MCU](pics/sfuVsMCU.png)

* Flexible routing API -> selective forwarding enables dynamic, richer applications at lower costs.
* On Amazon machines, can route up to 3,000 tracks
* Twilio's SFU determines the quality for each client
    * Simulcast packages various levels of quality to be processed by the SFU
* SFU can handle multiple codecs from/to other clients _(H.264, VP8, etc...)_
* Twilio's SFU provides a _single connection_ to the client _(vs mutliple)_:

## Programmable Voice Meets Custom Vocabulary Speech Analytics
### John Bocharov & Vineet Agarwal

![Programmable Vocab](pics/programmableVocab.png)

* Get callbacks when certain triggers happen.
    * Get what call the trigger happened on.
    * Twilio addon
* Voicebase in 60s
    * Cloud hosted pay-as-you-go speech analytics API
    * Provide customers to answers to _what_ is in their call
* Recording in dual channel produces much better results
* Live credit cards and SSNs are automatically redacted from the recording
* Get emotional predictors

![Live call analytics](pics/liveCallAnalytics.png)

## Examining the Barriers to Contributing to Open Source
### [Saron Yitbarek](http://bloggytoons.com/)

![Saron Yit](pics/saronYitbarek.png)

* [Jesse Frazzle](https://blog.jessfraz.com/) One of docker's star engineers had been continually haraased just for public speaking
* Everyone wants to provide value, but at some level people are denying folks these opportunities.
* [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) is a good place to start for Code of conducts for open source projects
* [I look like an engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Look_Like_an_Engineer)
* Contributing to open source (**Pre-Reqs**)
    * Code, but can start with README fixes
    * Communicate -> A lot of time is spent marketing and reviewing pull requests
    * Time _(money)_ -> Takes away from doing other things
    * Computer -> Obv
    * Internet -> Obv
* Internet Deserts -> 11 million people in US don't have access to wired broadband
    * Those that are affected are found in the lowest income areas
    * More than 1/2 the internet doesn't have internet
* We need to spend more time in more problem pools
* Follow people unlike yourself
* Inclusion >> Diverse
    * "Who are we leaving out?" vs _normal_ & _others_

## Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience
### Kyle Woumn & Malika Nikhmonova

![Dev Ex](pics/improvingDevOboard.png)

* Software engineers (NOT UX) are working to improve the onboarding
* The process of taking a new user to pay you `$$` and use the thing
* ~late 2016 xp = not the _BEST_ experience via a **Dashboard**
    1. Buy number
    2. Send message `from` twilio number
    3. Send message `to` twilio number
    4. Take you to docs
* _MOST_ people don't end back up at the dashboard
* Huge spectrum of devs
    * No-code
    * lots of code
    * Regardless of skill set you can get up and running
* Success at twilio is a funnel
    * Top is just signing up
    * Second is who sent a messages
    * Product active -> at least 10 messages/day
    * Finally -> Product spend $5- $1,000 month
* No use-case is still a use-case
* `Hippo` -> Highest paid person opinion
* A/B tests can be difficult to run. Mutlisession, bringing back feedback, 3rd party cookie buckets.
* `Geronimo`
    * Sits on top of a/b testing cool called split
    * Data-driven decisions
    * Mutli-device & multi-session support
    * Tie back to twilio metrics
* Provided images and flow charts and detailed instructions for appt remdinders
* Customers weren't aware they were given a `$`on sign up

![react router form](pics/reactRouterDev.png)

![use case routing](pics/useCaseRoutingDev.png)

* Sign up and then choose your use case
* Land on the specific langing page for your use-case
* Customers appreciated the _Use-case specific context_
* Less effort by componentizing stesp
    * Each one has about 5 steps
    * Total of 55 components
    * 5 point stories became 1 point stories
* Fewer onboarding mistakes
    * Fewer support tickets
    * Fewer API mistakes
* In the future they're going to focus on how to teach people to scale their applications
* Reduce the number of external links within the console.
* Once users leave the console they don't really come back ðŸ˜¢
* Add more use case coverage around SMS
