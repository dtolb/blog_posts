## Introducing the Twilio Super SIM
### [Andrew Jordan](https://signal.twilio.com/sessions/nRPgupzcEeiDzApYClWoBw)

> The IoT connectivity market is maturing quickly to support both high and low consumption devices. These categories are frequently referred to as Critical IoT (low latency, high throughput), and Massive IoT (high latency, low throughput). Join this session to learn how Twilio is solving for both Critical and Massive IoT with new Programmable Wireless offerings.

## Things Every Company Should Know About Machine Learning
### [Ahmad Khan](https://signal.twilio.com/sessions/zaARAJzbEeiTGQpYClWbCg)

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its most popular subfield, Machine Learning (ML), is all the rage these days. Futurists predict that every facet of our lives and every line of business is going to be transformed by ML. In this talk, we will focus on some of the key insights that every developer should know about ML. Theses insights will range from some of the key ML tools to some of the common fallacies and lessons learned related to the ML process. This is a high-level talk so no matter what your expertise level, you will likely walk away with some amount of learning.

## How the Super Network Solves SMS Issues at Scale
### [Lee Humby](https://signal.twilio.com/sessions/DnPrgqGdEeiJLApYClWbEg)

> The global SMS network can be an unforgiving place at times. Routes can go down because of carrier outages, messages can get delayed and even dropped completely, and local regulations can change at the drop of a hat. Detecting these issues before they affect your customers can be extremely challenging. In this session, you’ll hear about the systems and processes the Twilio Super Network uses to proactively detect and solve SMS deliverability issues to ensure our customers can always deliver their business-critical messages.

## Delight Future Customers with Outbound Marketing
### [Guillaume Cabane](https://signal.twilio.com/sessions/rDNZsLMtEeidLgpYClQbBA)

> If you think marketing is a horrible be necessary evil, you're right. And outbound campaigns are the worse example of bad marketing. Massive and not relevant for most people. But it doesn't have to be that way. For B2B SaaS, we can now tell who's in the market for a specific product. We can use 3rd party intent data and machine learning predictions to create delightful marketing. Outbound messages that bring value to your prospects, or even better, delight.

## The Hard Fought Battle of Production Machine Learning
### [Sam Phippen](https://signal.twilio.com/sessions/QDgJrqGeEeiGVQpYClWoDg)

> It's not uncommon, you have a problem where you finally need machine learning. You've got a great data science team. They come up with something, and put it out there, and then 6 month's later it's a broken down mess. We love our data science friends, but it's not their job to build great production software. As engineers, it's ours. In this talk, we'll go through the story of DigitalOcean's fraud prevention tooling, lovingly dubbed "sketchy". You'll learn about it's origin, our first attempt at using machine learning, and how we've come up with practical production machine learning strategies. You'll find out more about "standard" site reliability techniques, as well as how we change some of them for our ML work. This talk includes practical tips for everyone, but is best for those who have some experience operating production software.
